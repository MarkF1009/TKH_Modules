                      <h2>About Me</h2>
                      <p>The way that I came into technology was by chance. Never really plan on having an career or even a interest. The way I got into technology was one day while working at Bloomingdales as a janitor, which is interesting because fashion is were I plan to make my money at, while that was at the time before understanding both sides of tech. My thinking at the time while working at Bloomingdales was to learn the company system. To see the company store layout, how the clothing was being display, what type of clothing that was being displayed. How they would promote sales to increase foot traffic which generate overall store sales growth. But on this day while on break I got a email from Harlem Business Alliance and the eamail stated that I had the opportunity to learn how to code which would lead to knowing how to make a website. I was thinking learn to code so I can make my own website for my clothing brand. That program for on for about seven months, after graduating from Harlem Business Alliance(HBA) I apply and got into The Knowledge House(TKH) where further my Knowledge in tech. The first program I got into while attending TKH was learning about Digital Marketing which I learned about outlets that can help a Business or just someone social media grow for the better. Learning about branding outlets that can evaluate anyone paltform. This program lasted for about 4 months. Since than I have been learning about UX|UI design. I Been creating websites and mobile application using Adobe XD software which is a desgining tool kit. Now I'm just finihing this part of my education when it comes to web development. Learning front and back-end.</p>
